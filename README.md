# Code Review Challenge (turntabl)

At turntabl, we do a lot of pair programming with our engineers, especially those at the earlier stage of their career.  
The goal of this exercise is to provide a real feel of the kind of pair programming and code reviews we do. 
We are keen to know if this is something you enjoy and most importantly, if this is something you can do well.
We recommend that you spend 1 - 2 hours on this exercise but no more than 3 hours.

### Problem Statement
One of our engineers - Kwame, whom you could potentially be mentoring and managing has submitted some code for you to 
review. 
They would like you to review this before He/She sends it off to their client for a final review. 
Their client asked them to create a game of tennis. To play the game, you need to run the tests in `TennisGameTest`.
During each round, each player plays and is awarded a score. When both scores are submitted to the `tennisGame`, the 
game computes an `outcome`. Don't worry! You don't need to understand the rules of tennis to review this code.

Your task is to:
1. a complete code review. We will share the PR with you on github. Please add comments to the code 
highlighting things they've done well and things they can improve. Do your best to provide detailed feedback. this 
   engineer really needs it and wants to impress their client so all feedback welcome. Don't forget to add "why" you 
   think something is good or bad.
2. Create a branch stemming from the initial PR branch and add recommended changes or examples. Examples of what you mean sometimes helps software engineers understand what you mean better. If there is something you’d like to refactor and show them. Please create a branch from theirs, make changes and create a new PR that will request to merge to their own branch (not the main branch).


### Where is the code they submitted?
Share your github handle with your technical recruiter and we will add you as a reviewer on the pull request. 
It’s just like the real deal!


### What Happens Next?
Once you have completed the exercise, please let your technical recruiter know.  
They will schedule your next interview. 
During your next interview, we will be discussing your thoughts around the exercise and the feedback you’ve provided to 
this amazingly talented associate software engineer.
